# ETH-AVAX-Module-3

This Solidity program is a simple smart contract to create your own token. Once you have your contract, you should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens. 

It's a simple program based on four requirement:

create your own token
Only contract owner should be able to mint tokens
Any user can transfer tokens
Any user can burn tokens

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a smart contract to create your own token. Once you have your contract, you should be able to use remix to interact with it. From remix, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address. Any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started


# Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., mytokensidharth.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyTokenSidharth {

    //public variable 
    string public name = " SmartToken ";
    string public symbol = " ETH ";
    uint256 public totalSupply = 0;
  }

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "^0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "mytokensidharth" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

once the code is deploy then go to console button menu to see the transaction details.
